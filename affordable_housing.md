* Talked about goal of deciding what we will ask for from Blackwell & Mission First at the Wednesday meeting
* Went over background of the Arvilla affordable housing issue
* Went over backgrounds of those at the meeting
## Background of Arvilla Situation
* Mission first began the process of evicting tenants in order to sell the Arvilla building at the end of October 2018
  * extremely insensitive eviction process
* Mission first started with grants from many places, focused on serving the chronically mentally ill
* Today mission first has 1000's of units
* Arvilla was built in the 1920's as part of Garden Court
* Arvilla has 16 apartments in it
* Only 5 remain occupied
* Chronic issues with the boiler, inadequate heat in the building
* We forced them into a public meeting which was held at tghe Sprice Hill communicy association in December
* We would like to prevent the sale of other buildings in addition to this building
* Sonja worked with Philly power research to investigate the code violations for the buildings that mission first currently occupies
* Building code violations are chronically underreported in affordable housing complexes, vulnerable residents are hesitant to report
* Garden court was intended to be a mixed income neighborhood when it was built in the 1920's
  * More information could be found in the "National Register - History of Garden Court"
* On Wednesday there will be our group, mission first and Jannie Blackwell's office
* We would like to suspend the sale, maintain the building as 100% affordable
* It's not clear if the building is currently under contract
* Mission first *says* they can't make the building work financially, they say they are at the end of a tax credit and they cannot renew
* Blackwell's Office has thus far said they will ensure that any sale includes a 30% affordable housing requirement
* Suggested that ensuring any buyers know that a building is controversial might drive down the price they would otherwise offer
* Another mission first property is at 4501 Larchwood
* Low income housing tax credit, comes from federal money, funds renovation
* City money, state money also
* Questions about how many times, or how long must be waited until grants can be renewed
* Mission first says "Not a HUD building"
* Need money to make 100% affordable housing happen, 5million dollars, 3.5million are found in tax credits, so we need to find 1.5 million
* Rumors that the Arvilla was aquired for $10
* Places to get money:
  * Ask Blackwell, ask historical society, ask Penn (Jeff Cooper)
* Tuesday evening there will be a planning meeting
